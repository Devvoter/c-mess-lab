# C Mess Lab

This repository contains two C programming projects — originally created for university coursework or personal experimentation.

## Structure

- `projekt_1/` – Contains implementation of various utility functions, including bitset operations, error handling, and possibly prime number algorithms.
- `projekt_2/` – Appears to implement a hash table (`htab_*`), including insert, erase, and lookup operations.

## Note

Unfortunately, the original assignments or detailed descriptions of the projects are no longer available.  
The code is uploaded here for archival purposes and as a reference for future C development.

## Build

Both projects include a `Makefile`.  
You can try compiling them by navigating into each folder and running:

```bash
make
